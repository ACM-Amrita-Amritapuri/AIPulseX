INTRODUCTION

This project involves building a neural network model to classify Pokémon images based on their types. The aim is to preprocess the Pokémon images, remove their backgrounds, and then train a deep learning model to predict the type of a Pokémon based on its image. The types considered in this project include "Water," "Normal," "Grass," "Bug," "Fire," "Psychic," "Electric," and others categorized under "Other."

Workflow Summary:
1.The dataset is loaded, and the Pokémon types are classified into selected types or "Other."
2.Images corresponding to Pokémon names are loaded, backgrounds are removed, and they are resized to a standard size.
3.The images are encoded into a format suitable for model input, and their types are label-encoded.
4.The data is split into training and testing sets.
5.A neural network model is defined and trained using the training data with data augmentation.
6.Finally, the training process is visualized by plotting the accuracy over the training epochs.

Workflow Explanation:

1. Import Libraries

numpy, pandas, and matplotlib are used for data manipulation and visualization.
LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing is used for encoding categorical labels into numerical values.
train_test_split is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
tensorflow.keras is used to build and train the neural network model.
PIL (Python Imaging Library) and cv2 (OpenCV) are used for image processing.
glob is used to find files matching a specified pattern.

2. Background Removal Function

remove_background(image): This function removes the background from an image using thresholding.
Converts the image to grayscale.
Applies binary thresholding to create a mask.
Converts the mask to RGB.
Uses the mask to remove the background from the image.

3. Load and Process the Dataset

pokemons = pd.read_csv(...): Loads the Pokémon dataset from a CSV file.
selected_types: A list of Pokémon types that are of interest (e.g., Water, Normal, Grass).
pokemons['Type_Classified']: Creates a new column to classify Pokémon based on their type. If the Pokémon's type is in the selected_types list, it remains the same; otherwise, it's classified as "Other".
print(pokemons['Type_Classified'].value_counts()): Displays the count of each type in the new Type_Classified column to verify the distribution.

4. Load and Process Images

image_dir: Specifies the directory containing Pokémon images.
images: An empty list to store processed images.
The code iterates over the Pokémon names in the dataset and:
Searches for the image file corresponding to each Pokémon.
Opens and converts the image to RGB format.
Removes the background using the remove_background function.
Resizes the image to 120x120 pixels.
Converts the image to a NumPy array and appends it to the images list.
pokemons["Image"] = images: Adds the processed images to the DataFrame as a new column.

5. Visualize Some Images

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10)): Creates a figure to visualize the images.
A loop is used to plot 12 images along with their corresponding classified type.

6. Encode Labels and Prepare Data for Training

le = LabelEncoder(): Initializes a label encoder.
X = np.array(pokemons['Image'].tolist()) / 255.0: Converts the list of images into a NumPy array and normalizes the pixel values to the range [0, 1].
y = le.fit_transform(pokemons["Type_Classified"]): Encodes the Pokémon types into numerical values.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(...): Splits the data into training and testing sets (1/3 of the data is used for testing).

7. Data Augmentation

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(...): Defines a data augmentation generator to create more varied images by applying random transformations like rotation, shifting, zooming, and flipping.

8. Build the Neural Network Model

model = Sequential(): Initializes a sequential model.
model.add(Flatten(input_shape=(120, 120, 3))): Flattens the 3D image input (120x120x3) into a 2D vector for the dense layers.
model.add(Dense(256, activation="relu")): Adds a fully connected (dense) layer with 256 units and ReLU activation.
model.add(Dropout(0.4)): Adds a dropout layer to reduce overfitting by randomly setting 40% of the input units to zero during training.
model.add(Dense(128, activation="relu")): Adds another dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation.
model.add(Dropout(0.2)): Adds another dropout layer with 20% dropout.
model.add(Dense(nb_classes, activation="softmax")): Adds the output layer with units equal to the number of classes (nb_classes), using softmax activation for multi-class classification.
model.compile(...): Compiles the model using sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss, adam optimizer, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

9. Train the Model

training = model.fit(...): Trains the model using the augmented data from datagen. The model is trained for 50 epochs, and both training and validation accuracies are monitored.

10. Visualize Training Results

plt.plot(training.history["accuracy"], ...): Plots the training accuracy over epochs.
plt.plot(training.history["val_accuracy"], ...): Plots the validation accuracy over epochs.
plt.show(): Displays the plot.
