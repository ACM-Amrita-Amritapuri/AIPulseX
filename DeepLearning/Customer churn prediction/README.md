## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict customer churn using Deep Learning techniques. The notebook includes various stages of the machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing , model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](/home/abhi/Documents/GitHub/Hobby-Projects/Credit-Card-Churn-prediction/Churn_Prediction).

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, you need to install the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`


## Usage

To use this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd churn_prediction
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Churn_prediction.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells sequentially to process the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Results

This project successfully builds and evaluates a churn prediction model. The final model can be used to identify high-risk customers, enabling targeted retention strategies.
