# Computer Vision Project using CNNs and Transfer Learning

## Overview
This project implements a computer vision task using both a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **transfer learning** techniques. The model is trained to classify images efficiently, leveraging **Google Colab** for computation. Transfer learning is used to boost performance with a pre-trained model.

## Features
- Custom CNN architecture for image classification.
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models.
- Model evaluation using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Runs entirely on **Google Colab** for easy setup.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **OpenCV** (optional, for preprocessing)  
- **HDF5** (.h5 format for saving the model)  
- **Google Colab**

## Important Note
The pretrained model file (`pretrained_model.h5`) could not be uploaded to this repository due to file size constraints.
