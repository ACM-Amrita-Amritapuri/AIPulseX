# AIPulseX: An N-Day Machine Learning and Deep Learning Challenge üöÄ

Welcome to the AIPulseX repository! We are a team from the ACM Student Chapter, SIG AI, based at the Amrita School of Computing, Amritapuri. Our mission is to explore and implement various machine learning and deep learning projects over the next **N days**. Each day, we will work on a new project, documenting our progress and results clearly in individual project folders.

## Overview üåü

### What is AIPulseX?

AIPulseX is an intensive **N-day** challenge where our team will undertake continuous projects focusing on machine learning, deep learning, and various AI tool applications. Each project will be thoroughly documented, providing insights into our methodologies, results, and future work.

### Objectives üéØ

- To enhance our understanding and skills in machine learning and deep learning.
- To create a repository of diverse AI projects that can serve as a reference for future learners.
- To foster a collaborative and innovative environment within our SIG AI community.

### Team üë•

We are the SIG AI team from the ACM Student Chapter at Amrita School of Computing, Amritapuri. Our team comprises enthusiastic students dedicated to advancing our knowledge and skills in AI technologies.
