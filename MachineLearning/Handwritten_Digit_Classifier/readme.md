# Handwritten Digit Classifier

## Introduction 📘

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels.

## Project Details 📊

- **Model Used**: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- **Dataset**: The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of a single digit (0-9) in grayscale, sized at 28x28 pixels.
- **Preprocessing**: The images were flattened into 784-dimensional vectors, and pixel values were normalized to a range of 0 to 1.

## Challenges & Solutions 🚧

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Challenge**: Ensuring that the data is in the correct format and normalized.
  - **Solution**: Preprocessed the images by flattening and normalizing the pixel values to ensure efficient model training.

## Results 📈

The SVC model achieved high accuracy on the test dataset, effectively classifying handwritten digits. The model demonstrated strong performance, as evidenced by its ability to correctly predict digits from unseen data.

## Conclusion 📝

The project successfully implemented a handwritten digit classifier using an SVC model, achieving reliable results on the MNIST dataset. The model's robustness highlights its potential for real-world applications in digit recognition tasks.
