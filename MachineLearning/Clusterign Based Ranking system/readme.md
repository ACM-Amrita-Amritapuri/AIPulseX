**Project Title:** Building a Data-Driven Ranking System for Corporate Decision Making

### **Introduction**

In the complex and competitive landscape of corporate decision-making, choosing the best options among various business entities—such as products, customers, routes, and projects—can be a daunting task. In large organizations, where each decision has significant implications, the need for a structured, data-driven approach is paramount. This project aims to develop a sophisticated ranking system that leverages historical business data to assist management in making well-informed, objective decisions. By learning from data related to product performance, customer reviews, delivery routes, and market trends, the system classifies and ranks these entities according to how they align with predefined business goals. The model continuously improves its ranking accuracy by learning from new data, ensuring that it remains relevant and effective over time.

### **Project Details**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based ranking system that can automatically assess and rank various business entities to support corporate decision-making. The project involves:

- **Dataset Analysis:** Utilizing datasets such as IPL, BBL, and World Cup ODI, which include comprehensive performance statistics of players in different formats and leagues. This data forms the basis for training the ranking model.
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Implementing clustering techniques to group similar entities, which are then ranked based on their impact on business objectives.
- **Model Performance:** The effectiveness of the ranking model is evaluated by its ability to accurately identify and rank key entities that contribute to the company’s success.
- **Continuous Learning:** The model is designed to improve its ranking capabilities over time as it ingests new data, ensuring ongoing accuracy and relevance in decision-making.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

- **Data Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources (e.g., IPL, BBL, and World Cup ODI datasets) to create a unified framework was challenging. The solution involved careful preprocessing and alignment of data attributes to ensure consistency.
- **Clustering Quality:** Ensuring that the clusters formed were meaningful and contributed to accurate rankings was critical. This was addressed by using advanced internal and external validation techniques like the S_Dbw index and consensus clustering methods to enhance model stability.
- **Model Improvement:** The initial iterations of the model showed limitations in ranking accuracy. This was overcome by introducing more robust clustering algorithms and enhancing the model's learning mechanisms, enabling it to adapt and improve over time.
